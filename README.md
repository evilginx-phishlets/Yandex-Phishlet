# Yandex Phishlet: Leveraging Evilginx for Phishing Simulations

The **Yandex phishlet** for **Evilginx** offers a powerful tool for penetration testers, red teamers, and security researchers conducting phishing simulations. Evilginx, a man-in-the-middle attack platform, can bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and capture login tokens for platforms like Yandex, making it highly effective for real-world phishing scenarios.

## What is Evilginx?

[Evilginx](https://evilginx.net) is an open-source phishing framework that allows attackers to capture authentication tokens and session cookies, bypassing MFA on popular platforms. Unlike traditional phishing attacks that aim to steal passwords, Evilginx proxies user sessions and captures the tokens needed to bypass security measures, enabling full access to a victim’s account.

## Why Use the Yandex Phishlet?

The **Yandex phishlet** is a vital tool for simulating phishing attacks on one of Russia’s largest email and service providers, Yandex. As Yandex accounts often have MFA enabled, phishing simulations using the Yandex phishlet can help organizations test their defenses and identify weaknesses in their MFA implementations, providing insights into how attackers could exploit their systems.

## Setting Up Evilginx with the Yandex Phishlet

To begin using the **Yandex phishlet**, you need to install [Evilginx](https://evilginx.net) on your server. Evilginx includes several customizable phishlets, including one for Yandex. This phishlet simulates the Yandex login process, capturing session cookies and login credentials without the need for breaking MFA security.
